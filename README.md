## Execution boundary

Only allowlisted experimental policies may be edited by candidate-generating agents. Evaluators, hidden scenarios, baseline fixtures and safety constraints must be isolated. No live robot credentials, motion or flashing permissions. No safety-limit weakening.

The shared harness lives only in Jeffaaay/amr-faultbench. Exact dependency pins will be recorded before use. Oct 23–24 audit; Oct 25 schema freeze; Oct 26–Nov 1 isolated implementation and separately authorized measurements.
